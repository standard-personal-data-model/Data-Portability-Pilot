# Data Portability Pilot
### Goal: Real users port data from one Operator to another (via SPDM)!!
This will allow Operators to assure users they can takeout their data *AND* import it into other Operator solutions, which should expand the market and help all Operators.  

This will also provide requirements for what terms are needed in a Standard-Personal-Data-Model (SPDM).


## Needed: 
- Volunteer Operators: Map a few examples of their data to any of the SPDM candidates models, or even another such as Schema.org.

- Developers: Evolve mapping and transformation techniques. 

- Technical writers: Document all the parts. 

- Early adopters: Create accounts on Operator services to see what data they collect and allow takeout

These tasks are described as 'Issues' in this and other Repositories.
