## Real users port data from one Operator to another via SPDM!!
This will allow Operators to assure users they can takeout their data *AND* import it into other Operator solutions, which should expand the market and help all Operators.  

This will also provide requirements for what terms are needed in a Standard-Personal-Data-Model (SPDM).


##Needed: 
Volunteer Operators: Map a few examples of their data to any of the SPDM candidates models, or even another such as Schema.org.
Developers: Evolve mapping and transformation techniques. 
Technical writers: Document all the parts. 
Early adopters: Create accounts on Operator services to see what data they collect and allow takeout
These tasks are described as 'Issues' in this and other Repositories.
